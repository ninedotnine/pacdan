make all directions behave the same way; right now going right is special

add a buffer to the directions so the player doesn't have to be so precise

add multiple lives

add harder levels (more ghosties?)

add command-line args to vary the speed, number of ghosties, number of lives, etc.


internal:
use points more? or use them less? be consistent at least
can't build walls that start at 0
make the maze walls symmetrical?
consolidate CORRIDOR_SIZE and pixels better?

make ghosties eat you

make ghosties start going the correct direction they are initialized with

make different mazes

allow an arbitrary number of ghosties (with colours!)

figure out why the main loop stops if you don't move for 458 iterations

also learn why it sometimes freezes after a focusout automatic pause

better randomness

fix the FIXMEs

add version and put it in window name
